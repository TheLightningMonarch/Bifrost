1.  PRODUCT OVERVIEW
	1.1 PRODUCT OVERVIEW
		THIS PRODUCT, BIFROST, IS AN ACADEMIC DELIVERABLE MANAGER FOR STUDENTS USING CANVAS. IT TAKES THE DELIVERABLES(ASSIGNMENTS, QUIZZES, ETC...) ON THE CANVAS DASHBOARD AND SENDS THEM TO A LIST ON TRELLO FOR EASY MANAGEMENT. THIS PROGRAM ALSO MAKES SURE THAT THERE ARE NO DUPLICATE ASSIGNMENTS.

									----


3. 	SETUP:
	THIS IS THE INTIAL SETUP. AFTER THIS ONE TIME(PER DEVICE), THESE ARE NOT REQUIRED UNLESS AN ERROR OCCURS(SPECIFICS IN TROUBLESHOOTING).
	
	3.1. TRELLO SETUP:
	TO GATHER ACADEMIC DELIVERABLES INTO A MANAGEABLE LIST, BIFROST UTILIZES TRELLO FOR MANAGING THE LIST. AN API-KEY( FOR TRELLO IS REQUIRED FOR THE BUILT-IN PY-TRELLO API(3.1.2.).
	----
		IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE THESE STEPS, PLEASE FOLLOW ACCORDINGLY:
		1. CREATE AN ACCOUNT ON TRELLO.
			(https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/creating-a-new-trello-account/)
		2. CREATE A WORKSPACE AND THEN A BOARD FOR BIFROST NAMED "2023 Fall Semester".
	----

	3.1.1. SETTING UP THE BACKLOG:
	ON THE BOARD, CREATE A LIST FOR THE BACKLOG OF ACADEMIC DELIVERABLES TO BE DUMPED.
		IMPORTANT! THE LIST MUST BE CALLED "Bifrost Gateway". BIFROST WON'T WORK PROPERLY OTHERWISE.

	3.1.2. SETTING UP TRELLO API KEY:
	BIFROST TAKES CANVAS ASSIGNMENTS TO TRELLO. THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW ARE FOR SETTING UP TRELLO API-KEY.
````FOLLOW AS WRITTEN:
		TRELLO API KEY
			CREATION:
				1. GO TO: (https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)
				2. CREATE YOUR [API AS A] POWER UP: 
				FILL OUT THE INFORMATION AS FOLLOWS:
     				-POWER UP NAME: ANYTHING(LITERRALY)
     				-WORKSPACE: THE WORKSPACE WHERE THE BOARD FOR YOUR ACADEMIC DELIVERABLES RESIDES
     				-Iframe CONNECTER URL: NOT IMPORTANT. ANY PERSONAL URL/WEBSITE WORKS SINCE WE WON'T BE USING THIS FUNCTIONALITY.
     				-EMAIL: YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
     				-SUPPORT CONTACT: USE YOUR OWN EMAIL ADDRESS
     				-AUTHOR NAME: Y/N
				3. CLICK ON THE API.
				4. NAVIGATE TO API KEY ON THE LEFT SIDE BAR.
				5. THE API AND SECRET KEY ARE THERE TO BE COPIED. SECRET IS OPTIONAL.
				6. TO GENERATE A TOKEN, THERE IS A HYPER LINK CALLED TOKEN. CLICK IT.
				7. IT WILL LOAD A NEW PAGE AUTHORIZING THE KEY TO THE ACCOUNT. SCROLL DOWN(READ THROUGHLY) AND CLICK "ALLOW".
				8. COPY AND PASTE THE TOKEN KEY.
			IMPLEMENTATION:
				1. CREATE A TEMPORARY TEXT FILE AND SAVE ALL THREE OF THE FOLLOWING INSIDE AS SHOWN:
					<TRELLO API KEY>
					<TRELLO TOKEN>
					<TRELLO SECRET>

	!!!ATTENTION: YOUR API TOKEN WILL EXPIRE AFTER 30 DAYS OF INACTIVITY(LACK OF USE). HOWEVER, IT REFRESHES AFTER EACH USE!!!


	3.2. CANVAS SETUP:
	BIFROST FETCHES ACADEMIC DELIVERABLES FROM CANVAS. YOU ALSO NEED AN API KEY FOR CANVAS TO USE THE BUILT-IN API.
	TO GET ACADEMIC DELIVERABLES FOR THE LIST, BIFROST NEEDS ACCESS TO CANVAS(WHERE QUIZZES AND ASSIGNMENTS ARE KEPT) AND AN API-KEY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE PYHTON-CANVAS API(3.2.2.).


	3.2.1. SETTING UP THE CANVAS ACCOUNT:
		FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON YOUR SCHOOL WEBSITE TO CREATE THE ACCOUNT.

	3.2.2. SETTING UP THE CANVAS API KEY:
		CREATION:
			1. GO TO [CANVAS DASHBOARD](https://learn.vccs.edu/) 
			2. LOG IN. 
			3. THEN GO TO [SETTINGS](https://learn.vccs.edu/profile/settings). 
			4. CREATE A NEW ACCESS TOKEN IN THE "APPROVED INTEGRATIONS" SECTION BY CLICKING THE "+ NEW ACCESS TOKEN" BUTTON.
			5. FILL IN THE PURPOSE(e.g, "Canvas API") AND LEAVE THE EXPIRATION DATE BLANK. 
			6. GENERATE TOKEN

			!!!COPY THE CANVAS API ACCESS TOKEN ID BEFORE CLICKING OFF, OTHERWISE A NEW ONE WILL NEED TO BE REGENERATED.!!!

		IMPLENTATION:
			1. ONCE THE ACCESS TOKEN HAS BEEN OBTAINED, ACCESS THE SAME TEXT FILE AND WRITE INSIDE OF IT AS FOLLOWS:
				
				<CANVAS TOKEN>


		SO NOW, THE FILE SHOULD HAVE THE FOLLWING:
				<TRELLO API KEY>
				<TRELLO TOKEN>
				<TRELLO SECRET>						 
				<CANVAS TOKEN>



	3.3. GITLAB SETUP:
	THE APPLICATION, BIFROST, IS IN A GITLAB REPOSITORY. 
	
*THE REPO. IS CURRENTLY PRIVATE, SO AN ACCOUNT AND ACCESS IS REQUIRED TO DOWNLOAD BIFROST.*

		3.3.1. SETTING UP AN ACCOUNT:
		(https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up)
			MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE REPOSITORY, PROJECT VALHALLA.

		3.3.2. DOWNLOADING BIFROST:
		ONCE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO PROJECT VALHALLA, FOLLOW AS WRITTEN:
		1. SWITCH TO THE MAIN BRANCH.
		2. PROCEED TO DOWNLOAD THE ZIP OF THE BRANCH "MAIN" FROM THE REPOSITORY(FOR ACTUAL INSTALLATION OF BIFROST, REFER TO 3.5.)


	3.4. SOFTWARE SETUP:
	BIFROST IS WRITTEN IN PYTHON. THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR SETTING UP THE PROPER VERISON OF PYTHON:

		3.4.1. SETTING UP PYTHON
		GO TO [PYTHON DOWNLOADS](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31010/) AND DOWNLOAD PYTHON 3.10. OR 3.11.


		
	3.5. FINALIZING:
	FOLLOW AS WRITTEN:
		ONCE YOU DOWNLOADED THE REPO ZIP, UNZIP THE ZIPPED FOLDER.
		GO TO THE dist DIRECTORY INSIDE OF THE PROJECT FOLDER AND OPEN UP "txt.env".
			1. RENAME THE FILE SIMPLY BY GETTING RID OF THE "txt" NAME AND LEAVING IT BLANK. YOU SHOULD BE LEFT WITH A .env FILE.
			2. GO INSIDE THE FILE AND FILL OUT THE KEYS AND IDS THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED TEXT FILE.

		THE .env FILE SHOULD LOOK LIKE:

			canvas_dashboard_url = "https://learn.vccs.edu"
			canvas_access_token = <TOKEN>

			TRELLO_API_KEY = <KEY>
			TRELLO_TOKEN = <TOKEN>
			TRELLO_SECRET = <SECRET>


		!!!MAKE SURE THAT IT IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL FILE AND NOT A TEXT FILE! BIFROST WILL NOT WORK OTHERWISE!!!

									----


4. 	USAGE:
	4.1. WINDOWS:
			1. DOUBLE CLICK THE EXECUTABLE INSIDE OF THE dist DIRECTORY.

	4.2. LINUX:
			1. OPEN THE dist DIRECTORY IN YOUR TERMINAL.
			2. RUN:
				./Bifrost



5. TROUBLESHOOTING:
	5.1. REBUILDING THE EXECUTABLE:
	OPEN UP YOUR TERMINAL IN THE PROJECT FOLDER. 
	IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPUTER'S ANTI-VIRUS REMOVES BIFROST, THE STEPS FOR REBUILDING BIFROST ARE BELOW:
		1. INSTALL ALL THE REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES BY RUNNING:
			pip install -r requirements.txt

	PYINSTALLER SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN INSTALLED WITH THE INTIAL PYTHON INSTALLATION RUN IN Y0UR TERMINAL:
			pip install -U pyinstaller

	TO REBUILD THE EXECUTABLE, RUN IN YOUR TERMINAL:
	pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import=canvasapi --hidden-import=trello --hidden-import=parse --hidden-import=dotenv --clean Phase1/Bifrost.py
	

	5.2. IF 5.1 DOESN'T WORK, PLEASE CONTACT THE IT TECH SUPPORT:
	EMAIL: cchay@gmu.edu


6. IMPORTANT NOTES:
	THESE NOTES HAVE BEEN COLLECTED FROM THE WHOLE USER MANUAL FOR THE USER'S CONVEINCE:
		1. ATTENTION! YOUR API TOKEN WILL EXPIRE AFTER 30 DAYS OF INACTIVITY, BUT IT WILL REFRESH AFTER EACH USE.
		2. THE "SETUP" SECTION IS A ONE TIME(UNLESS ERRORS OCCUR).
		3. NEVER TOUCH THE CONTENTS OF THE .env FILE.
		4. COPY THE CANVAS API ACCESS TOKEN ID BEFORE CLICKING OFF, OTHERWISE A NEW ONE WILL NEED TO BE REGENERATED.
		6. FOR NON-WINDOWS-10 USERS, MAKE SURE THAT THE FILE THAT STORES THE API INFORMATION IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL FILE AND NOT A TEXT FILE! BIFROST WILL NOT WORK OTHERWISE.
